I have chosen to proceed with the second task, which is about extracting M&A information from news. 

please look at the notebooks in following order for understanding my implementation process:
1.manual_web_scrap
2.serpapi
3.labeling_data
4.spacy_ner
5.spacy_to_iob
6.FT_BERT_NER

I choose the BERT model for this task as it has better accuracy.
