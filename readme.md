This is a project about extracting Mergers & Acqusitions information from the news. 

please look at the notebooks in following order for understanding my implementation process:
1.manual_web_scrap
2.serpapi
3.labeling_data
4.spacy_ner
5.spacy_to_iob
6.FT_BERT_NER

After careful consideration, the BERT model is better for this task as it is more accurate.
